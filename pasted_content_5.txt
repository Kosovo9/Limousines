GENERA (SIN CÓDIGO):

1. PROJECT NEXORS: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PROBLEM:

- No solution for white-label transportation management

SOLUTION:
NEXORS: Global platform for specialized transportation
- SaaS for fleet management ($299-799/month)
- Commission on bookings (12-18%)
- 20 idiomas, 4 verticals (Corporate, Events, B2B, Tourism)
- Real-time tracking, AI pricing, driver management
- White-label ready (flotilla gets branded app)

MARKET:

- Serviceable addressable market: $5B (specialized segments)
- Competitive advantage: Specialization + white-label + global platform

TRACTION:

- Execution: Mitigated via experienced founding team, product-market fit first

RETURN ON INVESTMENT (For investors):
